    <p id="header" > WHAT DOES AN INFRACTION MEAN? </p>

    <p id="text" > A penalty in ice hockey is a punishment for an infringement of the rules. Most penalties are enforced by sending the offending player to a penalty box for a set number of minutes. During the penalty the player may not participate in play. Penalties are called and enforced by the referee, or in some cases, the linesman. The offending team may not replace the player on the ice (although there are some exceptions, such as fighting), leaving them short-handed as opposed to full strength. When the opposing team is said to be on a power play, they will have one more player on the ice than the short-handed team. The short-handed team is said to be "on the penalty kill" until the penalty expires and the penalized player returns to play. While standards vary somewhat between leagues, most leagues recognize several common varieties of penalties, as well as common infractions.</p>

                                                              <!-- SECTION 3: MINOR PENALTY + COMMON --> 
    <p id="header" > MINOR PENALTY </p>

    <p id="text" > A minor penalty is the least severe type of infraction. It results in the loss of a player for two-minutes, during which time the player must leave the ice and sit in a penalty box. During a minor hockey penalty, the other team has the advantage with an extra player on the ice. If the other team scores before the penalty is over, the player is released from the penalty box early. In some cases, an official may decide a minor penalty is worth more than two minutes, but is still not severe enough to warrant a major penalty. This will often be the case if a player was injured as a result of the penalty – in these cases a double-minor, or four-minute penalty can be issued.</p>

    <p id="header" > MISCONDUCT PENALTY </p>

    <p id="text" > A misconduct penalty results in a player being forced to sit in the penalty box for 10 minutes. These are penalties that are more severe than a major penalty, but still don’t warrant an ejection from the game. When a misconduct penalty occurs, the offending player must sit in the box for 10 minutes while one of his or her teammates serves the appropriate number of minutes for the initial infraction. Depending on league rules, the 10-minute timer on the misconduct penalty might not start until the two, four or five-minute penalty for the initial infraction has expired and the second player is released from the box. </p>
