<p id="text" > Hello! This is a message from the author of the program, Kalen Janmohamed! I used the API from the button up above that will take you to it. Was this project hard, YES! Did it teach me a lot about programming, Yes as well. The main skill I gained from this was problem solving however. I am a student at Upper Canada College in Toronto. This is a project for my Computer Science class, and the reason I chose to do it on hockey stats is because of my pride in the sport. From a young age, I'm sure many canadians can relate, I have played organized hockey. It wasn't until 2 years ago that I made my way to Single A Hockey, a great accoplishment for me personally. My family has been immersed in the world of hockey, always making a trip to a different place every year to watch my hometown team, Toronto Maple Leafs. I hope you enjoy the program as much as I enjoyed creating it. Please click the buttons at the top of you screen for the in depth code for this program as well as some information on me! </p>
